# Changelog

All notable changes to SpoolmanSync will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- Entity discovery now uses HA's WebSocket API with translation_key matching instead of regex-based entity name patterns, making discovery stable across entity renames and HA language changes (#50)
- Spool-to-tray assignments are now stored by unique_id (stable) instead of entity_id (can change if renamed)
- External mode automation registration now uses per-printer format matching embedded/addon mode, enabling stale automation detection for all deployment modes

### Added
- Dashboard warning banner when HA entity IDs have changed since automations were last configured
- Fallback matching for pre-migration spools that still use entity_id-based assignments

### Fixed
- Jinja2 null guard for `trigger.from_state`/`trigger.to_state` in generated automations, preventing errors on HA restart

### Removed
- `entity-patterns.ts` and associated tests (replaced by WebSocket-based discovery)

## [1.3.6] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- Tray material mismatch warnings no longer trigger for filament variants of the same base material (e.g., "PLA Matte" assigned to a tray reporting "PLA") (#49)

## [1.3.5] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- AMS discovery for user-renamed AMS devices with custom names (e.g., `ams_links_`, `ams_rechts_`, `ams_left_`, `ams_right_`) now works via device-based fallback (#47)

## [1.3.4] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- AMS entity detection for H2D printers using compact naming format (e.g., `sensor.h2d_ams2_1_humidity`, `sensor.h2d_amsht_1_humidity`) (#45, #47)
- External spool detection for H2D printers using underscore+digit naming (e.g., `sensor.h2d_externalspool_1_external_spool`) (#45, #47)

## [1.3.3] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- AMS HT entity detection for H2C printers using compact naming format (e.g., `sensor.h2c_ht1_humidity` instead of `sensor.h2c_ams_ht_1_humidity`) (#35)

## [1.3.2] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **Multi-external spool support** - Printers with multiple external spools (e.g., Bambu H2C) are now fully supported across discovery, dashboard, spool assignment, and automation config generation (#35)

### Fixed
- Active tray detection for external spools now uses the `active` attribute directly from ha-bambulab instead of inferring activity from AMS tray state, enabling accurate detection on multi-nozzle printers (#35)
- AMS HT entity detection improved with proper composite ID encoding and display name handling (#35)
- Usage report chart no longer shows gaps when days have zero usage; x-axis is now continuous

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Low filament stock alerts** — Get notified via Home Assistant persistent notifications when you're down to your last spool of a filament type and it's running low. Configurable thresholds (percentage or grams), grouping strategies (material, material+name, material+name+vendor), and selective group monitoring (#23)

### Fixed
- Printers with versioned ha-bambulab entities (e.g., `print_status` and `print_status_2`) no longer appear as duplicates on the dashboard (#35)
- External spool not detected for ha-bambulab versions using underscore hybrid entity names (e.g., `external_spool_externe_spoel`) — added support for all languages (#38)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Filament usage reporting dashboard** — New Reports page with summary cards, per-spool bar chart with filament color fills, stacked area chart for usage over time, and detail table. Filter by time period (7d, 30d, 90d, 1y, all) with automatic daily/weekly bucketing (#22)
- **Kiosk mode** — Touch-optimized interface at `/kiosk` for small screens with USB NFC/RFID readers (e.g., Raspberry Pi kiosk setups). Cookie-based opt-in, zero impact on normal users (#29)
- **App version display** — Version number shown in footer on all pages (#30)

### Fixed
- Null vendor on filaments no longer crashes the dashboard (#31)
- Number input fields in QR label settings no longer clamp values on every keystroke, allowing multi-digit entry (#32)
- Stacked area chart in usage report uses linear interpolation to prevent visual crossing artifacts

## [1.2.4] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- No longer store or auto-match against all-zero spool serial numbers from non-Bambu spools (#15)

## [1.2.3] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed
- Internal Next.js port (3001) no longer hardcoded in add-on mode — now derived dynamically from the configured direct access port to avoid conflicts on host_network (#27)

## [1.2.2] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **AMS filament info in unassigned tray banner** — the "Assign Spools to Trays" alert now shows the material, name, and color reported by the AMS for each unassigned tray, making it easier to find the matching Spoolman spool (#15)

### Fixed
- Generated REST command webhook URL in add-on mode now uses the configured port instead of hardcoded 3000 (#26)

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **"Remaining" weight badge** on dashboard tray slots showing filament remaining
- **Multi-color filament display** across all spool color swatches (dashboard, tray dialog, scan pages)
- **Expand/collapse toggle** for spool list in the QR label generator

### Fixed
- Remove printer button no longer deletes the printer from ha-bambulab — now only removes it from SpoolmanSync with the ability to re-add (#25)
- "Go to Settings" button on automations page navigated to a 404 in add-on mode (ingress path issue)
- Dashboard, automations discovery, and auto-configure now correctly filter out printers removed from SpoolmanSync
- HA restart after automation configuration in add-on mode now prompts user instead of restarting without warning
- Responsive UI improvements for logs filter buttons, tray "Remaining" badge, and label sheet print settings on small screens

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Multi-printer automation support** — Configure Automations now generates per-printer automations, helpers, and template sensors for all discovered printers instead of only the first (#20)
- **Spool sorting** — Sort by ID, Name, Material, or Vendor in the QR label generator, NFC writer, and tray assignment dialog
- **QR label sheet persistence** — Label sheet settings and printed-spool tracking are saved to localStorage across sessions
- **AMS Pro type-first entity naming** — Support for Danish and other locales where ha-bambulab produces entity IDs like `ams_pro_2_bakke_1` (#18)

### Fixed
- `utility_meter.calibrate` unknown action error — `cycle: none` is not a valid HA utility_meter value; omit the key entirely for no-cycle behavior (#19, #21)
- Responsive UI issues on logs page and tray assignment dialog on mobile

### Changed
- Helper entity names now include the printer prefix (e.g., `input_number.spoolmansync_{prefix}_last_tray`). **Existing users must click "Reconfigure Automations" once** after updating. Old singleton entities will become orphaned and can be manually deleted from the HA entity registry.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Multi-spool label sheet printing** — Select multiple spools and print QR labels on standard label sheets (e.g., Avery 8160). Configurable paper size, grid layout, margins, spacing, borders, and label content

### Fixed
- Incorrect filament usage for long prints crossing Monday midnight — utility meter was configured with `cycle: weekly`, causing HA to reset accumulated weight automatically (#19)
- False RFID mismatch warnings on non-Bambu (third-party) spools without RFID tags (#15)

## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- Configurable direct access port for the HA add-on — change in the add-on Configuration tab to avoid port 3000 conflicts with other add-ons (#14)

### Fixed
- QR code and NFC tag URLs now use the configured port instead of hardcoded 3000
- Removed confusing duplicate Network port section from add-on Configuration UI

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Home Assistant add-on** - Install directly from the HA add-on store with ingress sidebar integration; auto-discovers printers from ha-bambulab
- **QR code label generation** - Create and print QR code labels for spools; scan with phone camera to assign to AMS trays
- **NFC tag writing** - Write spool URLs to NFC sticker tags for tap-to-assign on Android devices
- **Dynamic spool assignment page** - QR scans and NFC taps redirect to a dedicated assignment page with tray selection
- **AMS 2 Pro and AMS HT support** - Entity pattern matching for newer AMS hardware variants
- **Auto-recovery for broken HA connections** - Embedded mode silently re-authenticates when tokens are invalidated; shows reconnect form if password was changed (#10)
- **Unraid Community Apps template** - XML template and icon for Unraid CA store

### Fixed
- External spool active tray detection for printers without AMS (#11)
- Crash when assigned spool has missing filament color or material data (#12)
- AMS discovery for entities with renamed or missing printer prefix
